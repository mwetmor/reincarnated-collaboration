# BV2F lane PH (galadriel) — RESUME

**Charter:** `agentic_orchestration/gandalf/notes/2026-10-06-barrow-v2-fidelity-run-charter.md` §§ 4, 5 (Phase 0 row 0.4), 9 (C-1..C-3). Plan § 4 Phase 0.4 (the P1–P11 table) and § 1 (v1 numbers).
**Phase:** 0 (no image spend). Write only under `runs/C-9/barrow_v2/fid/ph/` and this file.

## Phase 0 task: 0.4 the v1-parity harness, calibrated
Build `fid/ph/harness/` implementing P1–P11 (plan § 4 table). Inputs:
- **Positive control (must PASS every row):** v1 — `barrow_full/paint/barrow_full_painted.png`, `barrow_full/take/`, `barrow_full/godot/` (level `barrow_painted.tscn`), `barrow_full/captures/`. Lane PT will drop fresh v1 play-camera stills in `fid/pt/control/v1_stills/` (+ `views.json`); use existing captures until they land.
- **Primary negative control (R-C9-159):** `barrow_full/godot/data/barrow_v2_sw/`, `barrow_v2/section_v1cam/look/`, `barrow_v2/tools/v2sw_*`. It must FAIL at least P1 (ground at 50.3 px/m), P2/P3 (model bakes lit through the dynamic sun, `barrow_v2_sw.gd:643-669`; separate per-model paintings), P4 (cellularity — spectral peak at 6–20 px period on the bakes).
- **Secondary negative control (R-C9-158):** `barrow_v2/section_sw/` — negative for P9 only (no heather wind, no moving water, no snow trail); not required to fail quality rows (charter § 9 C-2).
Rules:
- **Quality rows (P1–P6, P11): a metric that cannot separate v1 from R-C9-159 is DISCARDED, not tuned.** Constraint rows (P7–P10) keep a v1 positive control but are not discarded for failing to separate 159 (charter § 9 C-1).
- Thresholds come from v1's own distribution (e.g., chunk-to-chunk spread), never from what 159 happens to score.
- Every metric must prove it can see a failure: for each row, a constructed failing input (e.g., a half-density resample for P1, a lit re-render or synthetic re-shade for P3, a stamped cellular texture for P4, a shifted seam for P5) — an instrument that only ever returns PASS is not an instrument.
- P11 (blind pair test) — build the crop-pair generator and answer key only; the judge is a fresh galadriel instance the conductor spawns with crops only (C-3). Do not judge your own test.
Deliver: `fid/ph/calibration.md` — the table (row × {v1, 159, 158, constructed-fail} → value, PASS/FAIL), each threshold with its v1 source, discarded rows with reason; `fid/ph/harness/README.md` with run commands; machine-readable `fid/ph/calibration.json`.

## Constraints
Heavy lock for any Godot render: `python3 runs/C-7/conductor_scripts/heavy_lock.py C-9 -- <cmd>`. Disk gate 21 GiB. Matt runs deletions. Never work around a permission denial.
Git: `git add -- <new paths>`, `git status --porcelain -- <paths>` before, `git commit --only <paths>`, `git show --stat HEAD` after. Never `git add -A`. Do NOT edit/commit `ledger.json`. Do not push.

## State
- [ ] harness P1–P11
- [ ] calibration table (v1 pass / 159 fail / constructed fails)
- [ ] P11 pair generator + answer key
