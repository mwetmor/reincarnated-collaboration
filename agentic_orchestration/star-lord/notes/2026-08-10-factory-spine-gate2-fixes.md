## 1. Top line

Both BLOCK findings are closed, plus four DRIFT-CRITIC items. 164 tests green (was
136). The live run still passes and `DETERMINISM: EXACT` still holds.

The F1 fix widened past what either review asked for, because closing the named hole
exposed two more of the same species. Those are § 3 and § 4, flagged rather than
buried — a reviewer who reads only § 2 will have an incomplete picture of what
containment now costs.

| Finding | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **F1** — fingerprint blind to gitignored writes in every tree | jack-ryan / gandalf D-1 | **CLOSED** |
| **F2** — non-git declared repo fails OPEN | jack-ryan | **CLOSED** |
| **D-3** — `verdict_consistent` greens vacuously anywhere but last | gandalf | **CLOSED** |
| **D-4** — `report.py` hard-codes the dollars caveat | gandalf | **CLOSED** |
| **D-6** — closed harness lane discovered mid-run | gandalf | **CLOSED** |
| **D-7** — a red phase's notes travel unlabelled | gandalf | **CLOSED** |
| **O4** — drop vs. keep the dollars figure | gandalf ⟷ jack-ryan **disagree** | **SURFACED to Matt** (§ 6) |
| **D-2** — mechanical phases need a phase-level `exec:` | gandalf | queued |
| **D-10** — no HALT status | gandalf | queued, § 6 |

## 2. F1 and F2 — what changed

**F1.** The exemption was a CATEGORY ("anything git ignores") applied to fix a
NAMED problem (the factory's own `sessions/` writes reading as self-breach). That
category covered the engine's `seasons/` (3.3 GB) and `telemetry.db` (450 MB) —
inside the tree the workflow declares read-only. jack-ryan proved it with a live
run; the file survived and the run went green.

The exemption is now six named paths (`FACTORY_RUNTIME_PATHS`), root-repo only.
Everything else git ignores is measured like anything else. `git status` is called
with `--ignored=traditional`, and the collapsed directory entries are swept
recursively.

The test that pinned the hole as the requirement (`test_permissions.py:211`) is
inverted into its falsification partner: **a gitignored write must now breach.**
Four more hold the line from the other sides — the exemption does not apply to
non-root repos, does not cover factory *source* under the same directory, is
recorded on the fingerprint when taken (`exempted`), and fails CLOSED when git
collapses an untracked ancestor above an exempt path.

**F2.** A declared repo that is not a git worktree produced `is_git=False`,
recorded honestly and then never read — so the diff came back empty and empty read
as innocent. Two halves:

- **Load time:** every `repos:` entry must exist and be a git worktree, or the
  workflow does not load. Also: every `read_only_trees:` entry must be covered by
  some `repos:` entry, because a read-only tree that nothing fingerprints is a
  promise nobody checks. (The shipped KC2 workflow already satisfied this by
  convention; it is now a rule, with a test that asserts it against the real file.)
- **Mid-run:** `TreeFingerprint.usable` is consulted, and `diff_fingerprints`
  raises `ContainmentError` rather than returning `[]`. "Nothing moved" and "we do
  not know" no longer share a return value.

## 3. What closing F1 exposed — the interpreter writes too

With gitignored paths visible, running the engine's pytest wall inside the
declared-read-only engine tree writes `__pycache__/` there. That is a real write to
a read-only tree, and containment correctly called it.

The fix is to stop the write, not to re-exempt the path: `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1`
and `PYTEST_ADDOPTS=-p no:cacheprovider` in the gate subprocess environment. A
read-only claim that quietly tolerates one class of write is not a read-only claim.

Verified after the run: zero `__pycache__` writes in the engine tree.

**This is the shape of the original defect, one layer down.** The tempting fix was
another exemption. Naming it here because the next person to hit a false breach
will be tempted the same way, and the tell is identical: an exemption proposed to
make a red go away rather than to describe something true.

## 4. What closing F1 cost — and the honest limit of the claim

Measuring what was previously exempt is not free. The godot tree's `.godot/` +
`Assets/Synty/` hold **259,000 files**: ~12 s to stat-sweep, nine fingerprints per
run. That is longer than the run.

So measurement now has **two declared tiers**:

- **EXACT** — every file stat'd. Catches creation, deletion, in-place edits.
- **COARSE** — directory mtimes + entry counts (905 dirs, 0.12 s for the same
  region). Catches creation, deletion, rename. **Does NOT catch an in-place rewrite
  of an existing file.**

A region over 50,000 files falls back to COARSE. Every phase emits a
`containment_coarse` receipt naming the regions and the caveat verbatim, so a later
reading of "the read-only tree was clean" carries the strength of the claim with it.

The blind spot is pinned by a test that asserts coarse measurement **fails** to see
an in-place edit. If a future change makes it see one, that test reds and the
caveat can be weakened *on evidence*.

**Run cost:** 1m26s (was ~30 s pre-fix, and 2m36s in the first version of this fix,
which spent 50,000 stats per oversized region learning something the cheap pass
answers for free). Determinism unaffected: `DETERMINISM: EXACT — 14 gate verdicts
identical across two laps`.

**Where I want a reviewer's eye:** COARSE is a genuinely weaker claim than the
spine advertised, and I chose it over both alternatives (12 s × 9 per run, or
leaving the region unmeasured). It is labelled everywhere it appears, but a label
is not the same as coverage. If the founding run's threat model includes an agent
rewriting a file in place inside `.godot/`, this tier is not sufficient and the
answer is to declare a narrower read-only tree rather than to trust the label.

## 5. The four DRIFT-CRITIC items

- **D-3.** `verdict_consistent` adjudicates the reports that ran BEFORE it, so
  anywhere but last it greens over gates it never saw. Now a load error naming its
  position.
- **D-4.** `report.py` hard-coded the subscription caveat into the totals line —
  the number and its meaning joined by the renderer's assumption rather than by the
  receipt. It now READS `dollars_sources` from the DB. An unregistered source
  prints raw with "no gloss registered"; a figure with no recorded provenance
  renders as **"provenance unrecorded; this figure cannot be read as money spent"**
  and is explicitly forbidden from inheriting the subscription caveat (asserted).
- **D-6.** A closed harness lane (Codex, blocked on **T16**) now fails at LOAD,
  naming the blocker — not after the phases ahead of it have burned.
- **D-7.** `notes_for_next_agent` from a phase that went red read identically to
  notes from one that passed. Now prefixed with the phase name, its status, and
  *"treat them as a lead, not as an established result."* The notes still travel —
  this is a label, not a filter. Empty notes stay empty.

## 6. What I did NOT decide, and why

**O4 — the dollars figure.** gandalf ruled **DROP** it (recomputable from tokens +
model + price table; the $0.0672 corresponds to no artifact). jack-ryan explicitly
**disagreed** and would keep it as shipped. Two seam stewards, opposite rulings, both
reasoned.

I implemented neither. D-4 is done either way — the figure is now labelled *from the
receipt*, so if it stays it cannot be read as money spent, and if it goes the
renderer needs no change. **This is Matt's call**, and it is cheap in both
directions right now; it gets expensive once a surface renders it.

**D-10 — no HALT status.** gandalf calls this the largest gap for the founding run.
A phase can PASS, FAIL, or the run can ABORT on a breach. There is no way for an
agent to stop and say *"the premise is wrong, do not retry me, get a human"* — which
is exactly the KC2 halt that made the last run trustworthy. Retrying an agent whose
premise is wrong is how a factory manufactures confident garbage. I did not add it
in this pass because it is a new status in the receipts schema (SCHEMA_VERSION bump
+ MIGRATION note) and a new envelope field in the synced triad — that is a design
decision about the run protocol, not a defect fix, and it wants a dispatch.

**D-2 — phase-level `exec:` for mechanical cells.** Queued. Mechanical work
currently rides inside a gate command, which is what created the double-fingerprint
hole recorded in the landing note. Same reasoning: a shape change, not a fix.

## 7. Acceptance, restated

| # | Spec A § 11 item | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Baton-scene mechanical cells run end-to-end | **PROVEN** — 3 phases, 14 verdicts, all green |
| 2 | Determinism assertion | **PROVEN** — `DETERMINISM: EXACT` |
| 3 | Zero stub gates (grep-provable) | **PROVEN** — 3 independent proofs |
| 4 | Synced-triad green; breach ⇒ rollback + abort | **PROVEN** — and containment now measures what it claims to |
| 5 | jack-ryan Gate-2 PASS | **RE-SUBMITTED** — F1 + F2 closed |

164 tests. Scope: meta-repo writes only; engine and godot trees read and executed,
never written (verified post-run).
